Project description:
I am trying to work on a movie database where the main feature (which is being asked in this class) 
Is to show a client and serverside communication.  That being said i want to try doing something where a
consumer can click on "add to watch list" on certain movies, and when the costomer clicks on "watch list"
It will pull the data according to that list.  basically only showing what they're watching.
